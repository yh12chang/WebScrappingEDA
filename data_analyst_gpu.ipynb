This EDA will look at the current graphics processing unit (GPU) market of the Nvidia cards provided by the platform of Newegg. Data for each GPU will be retrieved using Web Scrapping through python packages: *BeautifulSoup4*, *requests*. Prices of each card and model will be compared to the initial release MSRP, along with performance ratings and possible recommendations for which GPU is worth the most value at this moment."
